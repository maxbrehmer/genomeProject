#### Updates

- Modified data to include 10 and 100 lines respectively

- Removed unnecessary columns from data file

#### Comments

I used sed -n '1st_line, nth_line p; n+1th_line q' datafile > newfile
to extract rows 1 to n into a new file
and
cut -f1,n datafile > newfile
to only copy columns 1 to n into a new file.

#### Updates

- Moved static main method to Main class

- Scanner now only takes every 12th input

#### Comments

My plan now is that every identifier is put in the hash table, then each key is added as a vertex in the graph. The file is then copied and removes all completely overlapped verticies before all verticies in the graph get stored in a reduced graph with all removed nodes taken out.

#### Updates

- Added node degree distribution

#### Comments

A lot left for the last day, i need to
1. remove completely overlapped contigs
2. implement function to count number of components and component size distribution
3. run the code on the full graph
4. present results in histograms
5. complete the report
