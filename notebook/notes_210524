#### Updates

- Modified data to include 10 and 100 lines respectively

- Removed unnecessary columns from data file

#### Comments

I used sed -n '1st_line, nth_line p; n+1th_line q' datafile > newfile
to extract rows 1 to n into a new file
and
cut -f1,n datafile > newfile
to only copy columns 1 to n into a new file.
